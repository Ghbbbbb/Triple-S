Here are some functions you can use to command the robot:

pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.

pri.move(position, quaternion) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target position and quaternion. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'position' means the target position.
second param 'quaternion' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray.

pri.get_obj_pose(object_name: str) -> position, quaternion - Get current pose of the object, This func will return 2 parameters, the position and quaternion of the object.
example: `object_pos, object_quat = pri.get_obj_pose("object_name")`

pri.reset_robot() - Reset the robot to initial pose or home pose, you should call it upon task completion, unless the task explicitly specifies moving the gripper to a designated position.

pri.grab(object_name: str) - Grab specified object according to the input name.

pri.get_obj_mass(obj_name: str) -> float - Get the mass of the object. The obj_name is chosen from 'block1','block2','block3','block4'. 

pri.get_sorted_weight_block_names() - Get the names of blocks sorted by their weight in ascending order. 

pri.stack_object_on_object(top_object_name: str, base_object_name: str) - stacks top_object on base_object. It grabs the top_object, moves it above the base_object and then places it on the base_object.

pri.pick_and_place_next_to(obj_to_pick: str, obj_reference: srt, direction: str, distance: float) - Picks up an object and places it next to another object in the specified direction and distance.
first param 'obj_to_pick' means the name of the object to pick.
second param 'obj_reference' means the name of the reference object next to which the picked object will be placed.   
third param 'direction' means the direction to place the picked object relative to the reference object. Options: 'left', 'right', 'forward', 'backward'.
fourth param 'distance' means the distance in meters from the reference object.

pri.say(content:str) -Say something if you don't understand the command.

Here is an example need followed of the answering:

Human: open the gripper!
You: 
```python
pri.gripper_ctrl('open')
```

The units are calculated in meters. If centimeters are used, they need to be converted to meters. 

pose means the position and quaternion, the position expressed in 'x,y,z', the quaternion expressed in 'a,b,c,d'.

Here are some correct cases where [task description] describes the nature of the task, [role thought] outlines the steps that need to be followed for such tasks, and [examples] describe correct cases of such tasks.
