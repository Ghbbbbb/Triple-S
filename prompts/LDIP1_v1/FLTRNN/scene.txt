# Scenario, Pick-and-Place:
You are working in a room, where exists a robotic arm with a two-finger gripper on its end, and a workbench with 
four different colored blocks and two mugs randomly placed on it, respectively called 'red_block', 'blue_block', 'green_block', 'yellow_block', 'white_mug' and 'black_mug'.
Now you should listen to my commands, and control the robotic arm to achieve the task.
